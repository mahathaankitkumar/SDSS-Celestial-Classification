A field is basically a part of the entire image corresponding to 2048 by 1489 pixels. A field can be identified by:\n- **run** number, which identifies the specific scan,\n- the camera column, or \"**camcol**,\" a number from 1 to 6, identifying the scanline within the run, and\n- the **field** number. The field number typically starts at 11 (after an initial rampup time), and can be as large as 800 for particularly long runs.\n- An additional number, **rerun**, specifies how the image was processed. \n\n#### View \"SpecObj\"\n\n* specobjid = Object Identifier\n* class = object class (galaxy, star or quasar object)\n\nThe class identifies an object to be either a galaxy, star or quasar. This will be the response variable which we will be trying to predict.\n\n* redshift = Final Redshift\n* plate = plate number\n* mjd = MJD of observation\n* fiberid = fiber ID\n\nIn physics, **redshift** happens when light or other electromagnetic radiation from an object is increased in wavelength, or shifted to the red end of the spectrum. \n\nEach spectroscopic exposure employs a large, thin, circular metal **plate** that positions optical fibers via holes drilled at the locations of the images in the telescope focal plane. These fibers then feed into the spectrographs. Each plate has a unique serial number, which is called plate in views such as SpecObj in the CAS.\n\n**Modified Julian Date**, used to indicate the date that a given piece of SDSS data (image or spectrum) was taken.\n\nThe SDSS spectrograph uses optical fibers to direct the light at the focal plane from individual objects to the slithead. Each object is assigned a corresponding **fiberID**. \n\n**Further information on SDSS images and their attributes:** \n\nhttp://www.sdss3.org/dr9/imaging/imaging_basics.php\n\nhttp://www.sdss3.org/dr8/glossary.php"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ffb06ef6-73f7-4f42-ab42-5d5b5f773ba7","_uuid":"04e88f8c9c12167a1c23e47b3e2046246510e983","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#sdss_df = pd.read_csv('Skyserver_SQL2_27_2018 6_51_39 PM.csv', skiprows=1)\nsdss_df = pd.read_csv('../input/Skyserver_SQL2_27_2018 6_51_39 PM.csv', skiprows=0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ca3f2be5-d15c-47ef-bc29-9a254ce2199d","_uuid":"776947da30d7e7e2b88bd87dca65eaa8b04b158c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Exploration"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c5f29b18-e5f3-4b99-8abe-ce6f492f0584","_uuid":"8fd7a1ae6fb17276694385e527fbfd98d548be4a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Basic stats about our dataset"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6246cf67-967f-4e01-99d0-191b0ea3a8d9","_uuid":"5f49f9775c7d5cb9e46e725dbceb1269d7c23416"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a first look at our dataset to see what we're working with!"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"_cell_guid":"26b460b4-d472-440b-b690-d8c12f267944","_uuid":"149d00bab55383b7014daf916df81410717b643a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sdss_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"aec349a7-7dcd-4e93-b9d1-5a8f032ca6c7","_uuid":"43d8f5997c96f67ff4445ba00cd60c1d3f36d744"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can tell that we have all the features as described in the above query. \n\nWe notice that there are no categorical features at all - besides the class column.
