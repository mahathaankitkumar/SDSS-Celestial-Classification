This project focuses on classifying celestial objects, specifically galaxies, stars, and quasars, from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) RD14 dataset. Using data analysis techniques, features such as redshift and filter magnitudes were explored to improve classification accuracy. The project leverages libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost to refine the classification process and extract valuable insights.
